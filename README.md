# DOS_attack_prevention

I have developed a Denial of Service (DoS) attack prevention project using Python. The project aimed to protect a web server from excessive requests by implementing a rate limiter. Initially, I chose Python for its versatility and ease of use in handling network-related tasks. I utilized Flask, a lightweight web framework, to create a simple web server environment for testing. The core of my solution was a `RateLimiter` class that tracked incoming requests based on client IP addresses and timestamped them. Using time-based filtering, the class ensured that no client could make more than a specified number of requests within a defined time window. This rate limiting mechanism effectively mitigated potential DoS attacks by preventing server overload. Through iterative testing and debugging, I refined this implementation to ensure robustness and reliability, demonstrating how foundational Python libraries and frameworks can be leveraged for practical cybersecurity applications.
